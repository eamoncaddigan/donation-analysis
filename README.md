# Leverage donation analysis

Analysis of donation data in the donor database. This repository contains code to categorize donors and summarize the amounts received by local candidates from every type of donor.

## CaaSH

This branch is for the necessarily quick-and-dirty implementation that will be developed for the City as a Service Hackaton in September 2016.

Moreover, much of the work here will eventually make it to Lever-age/data-pipeline after it's been cleaned up and "productionized".
